### General

Update changelog.md with any changes.
Create a new section of the changelog every day there are changes. 
The changelog should have a header of the current date.

### Code Guidelines

Always use file-scoped namespace declaration.
Always put using statements after the namespace declaration.
Sort using statements alphabetically.
Remove unnecessary using statements.
Use readonly local variables where possible.
Use const strings where possible.
Remove unused variables.
Investigate unused methods. Are they needed?
Don't embed class definitions or enumerations with code methods. Bring them into their own classes. Consider using an Enums and Models folder or similar names to put those extractions into.

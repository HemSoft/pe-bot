# PE-Bot (Performance Engineering Bot)

A specialized bot designed to assist with performance engineering tasks. This tool helps automate performance testing, analysis, and reporting processes.

## Overview

PE-Bot is built to streamline performance engineering workflows by:
- Automating performance test execution
- Analyzing performance metrics and results
- Generating comprehensive performance reports
- Identifying performance regressions
- Providing recommendations for performance improvements
- Searching and retrieving information from Confluence

## Features

### Confluence Integration
PE-Bot can search and retrieve documents from Confluence based on user queries. Users can:
- Search for specific topics in Confluence
- Request the latest documents from Confluence (e.g., "What are the 5 latest confluence docs updated?")
- Request the latest documents about a specific topic (e.g., "What are the latest documents about performance testing?")
- Limit the number of results returned (e.g., "show me the top 5 documents about performance testing")
- Get documents sorted by recency with accurate "last updated" information

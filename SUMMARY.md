# Confluence Integration Issue Summary

## Issue
The Slack bot is not correctly displaying Confluence search results when asked about documentation. When users ask for Confluence documentation, the bot sometimes responds that there are no documents available, despite the Confluence integration working correctly when tested directly.

## Investigation Findings
1. **Confluence Integration Works Correctly**: When tested directly using the `--test-confluence` option, the Confluence integration correctly retrieves and displays search results.
2. **System Prompt Updated**: We updated the system prompt to provide clear instructions for handling Confluence searches, including:
   - Always using the `SearchConfluence` function for documentation queries
   - Never stating that no documents are available unless explicitly returned by the function
   - Showing 10 results by default unless a different number is requested
   - Ordering results by most recent updates first

3. **Tool Call Handling Issue**: The `AssistantClientSdk` class is not properly handling the `RequiresAction` status, which is needed for tool calls. We attempted to fix this by updating the class to handle tool calls using the `AssistantRunManager`, but we're still encountering an error.

## Recommendations
1. **Fix Tool Call Handling**: The `AssistantClientSdk` class needs to be updated to properly handle the `RequiresAction` status for tool calls. This will require:
   - Adding code to process tool calls using the `AssistantRunManager`
   - Ensuring that tool outputs are properly submitted back to the assistant
   - Handling the response after tool calls are processed

2. **Update Azure OpenAI SDK**: Consider updating to the latest version of the Azure OpenAI SDK, which may have improved support for tool calls.

3. **Implement Logging**: Add more detailed logging to help diagnose issues with tool calls, including:
   - Logging the run status at each step
   - Logging the tool calls and their arguments
   - Logging the tool outputs and the assistant's response

4. **Alternative Approach**: If the issue persists, consider implementing a custom solution that directly calls the Confluence API when users ask for documentation, bypassing the assistant's tool call mechanism.

## Next Steps
1. Implement the recommended fixes for tool call handling
2. Test the changes with various Confluence search queries
3. Monitor the bot's responses to ensure it correctly displays search results
4. Update documentation to reflect the changes made
